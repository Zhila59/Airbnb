I have a few properties in mind but want to see if I can generate some extra revenue through AirBnB. How can I estimate the rental price that each property can go for on AirBnB, based on its characteristics?
I used some regression models in this project like: linear regression, ElasticNet, DecisionTreeRegressor and SGDRegressor.
